3 Refugee statistics, including top regions of origin and destination countries.
4 Weapon usage trends, including missile strikes and drone deployments.
5 Financial data, such as Russiaâ€™s war spending and the cost of lost equipment.

Key insights:

1 Drones account for 34.74% of total losses, reflecting their critical role in modern warfare.
2 marked the peak year for equipment losses, with a slight decline in 2024â€“2025, possibly due to resource depletion or tactical shifts.
3 Refugee flows highlight severe displacement, with Poland and Germany hosting the majority of migrants.
4 Russiaâ€™s war spending exceeds $300 billion, with high-value equipment like the cruiser "Moscow" and A-50U aircraft contributing significantly to losses.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Military Losses Dashboard
Purpose:
To analyze the scale and distribution of Russian military equipment losses over time.

1 What it shows:
2 Hierarchy of losses: Drones (32,425) > Artillery (26,163) > Armored Vehicles (22,088) > Tanks (10,603).
3 Aircraft and helicopter losses: 335 helicopters and 370 aircraft destroyed.
4 Total confirmed losses: 57,952 units by 2025.

Key insights:

1 Drones dominate losses, emphasizing their vulnerability or high deployment rate.
2 Artillery and armored vehicles follow, indicating intense ground combat.
3 Low aircraft losses suggest limited air engagements or effective countermeasures.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Refugee Movement Dashboard
Purpose:
To track displacement trends and migration patterns caused by the war.

What it shows:

1 Top regions of origin: Danetsk (1M), Khartav (800K), Zaporizhinka (600K).
2 Destination countries: Poland (38.44%), Germany (26.43%), Czech Republic (12.97%).
2 Total refugees: 6.369 million.

Key insights:

1 Eastern Ukraine (e.g., Danetsk) experienced the highest displacement.
2 Poland and Germany bear the largest refugee burden, highlighting EU solidarity.
3 Refugee numbers correlate with major offensives and occupation patterns.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Weapon Usage Dashboard
Purpose:
To evaluate the types and frequency of weapons deployed by Russia.

What it shows:

1 Top weapons: Shahed-136/131, X-101/X-505, Kalibr missiles.
2 Missile strikes by region: Focus on military and urban targets.
3 FPV drones: 32,425 deployed at a cost of $12.97M.

Key insights:

1 Shahed drones and cruise missiles are Russiaâ€™s most-used weapons.
2 FPV drones offer cost-effective strikes but suffer high attrition.
3 Strikes align with territorial battles and infrastructure targeting.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Financial Expenditures Dashboard
Purpose:
To quantify the economic impact of the war on Russia.

What it shows:

1 Total war spending: $300B.
2 Most expensive losses: Cruiser "Moscow" (750M),Aâˆ’50U(350M), Su-34 ($50M).
3 Weapon costs: X-101/X-505 missiles incurred $23.9B in expenses.

Key insights:

1 High-value losses like the "Moscow" signify strategic Ukrainian successes.
2 Drone warfare is cost-efficient compared to missiles.
3 Financial strain may impact Russiaâ€™s long-term military capacity.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Combined Trends and Projections
Purpose:
To synthesize data across dashboards for strategic conclusions.

Key insights:

1 War dynamics shifted from heavy armor (2022) to drones/missiles (2023â€“2025).
2 Refugee outflows stabilized after 2023 but remain a humanitarian crisis.
3 Russiaâ€™s spending and losses suggest unsustainable attrition without tactical adjustments.
